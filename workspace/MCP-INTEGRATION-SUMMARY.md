# MCP Server Integration Summary

This document summarizes how the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is now fully integrated into the workspace template system, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

## Integration Overview

The MCP server configuration is now **automatically handled** during workspace creation through the `workspace-template.yaml` deployment process. No manual configuration scripts are needed.

## How It Works

### 1. Template Preparation
The workspace template files (including MCP server) are copied to kind nodes using:
```bash
./mvp-roo-saas/scripts/setup-workspace-template.sh
```

This copies the entire `workspace/` directory to `/opt/workspace-template/` on each kind node.

### 2. Automatic Workspace Setup
When a new workspace is created via the frontend, the `workspace-template.yaml` automatically:

1. **Installs Node.js** in the container
2. **Copies MCP server files** from `/workspace-template/.mcp-servers/`
3. **Installs dependencies** with `npm install`
4. **Builds the MCP server** with `npm run build`
5. **Creates Cline MCP configuration** at the correct location:
   ```
   /home/workspace/.openvscode-server/data/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json
   ```

### 3. MCP Configuration Content
The automatically created configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workspace-deployment": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/home/workspace/.mcp-servers/workspace-deployment/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_ROOT": "/home/workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Benefits

✅ **Zero Manual Configuration** - MCP server is ready immediately when workspace starts
✅ **Consistent Setup** - Every workspace gets the same MCP configuration
✅ **Automatic Building** - MCP server is compiled during workspace initialization
✅ **Proper Paths** - All paths are correctly configured for the container environment
✅ **No Restart Required** - Configuration is in place before Cline starts

## File Structure in New Workspaces

```

```

## Available MCP Tools

Once a workspace is created, these tools are immediately available in Cline:

1. **`scaffold_configmap_app`** - Create deployment boilerplate
2. **`deploy_app`** - Deploy with Skaffold
3. **`get_deployment_status`** - Check deployment status
4. **`get_deployment_logs`** - Get application logs
5. **`cleanup_deployment`** - Clean up resources

## Deployment Process

1. **Setup Template** (one-time):
   ```bash
   cd mvp-roo-saas
   ./scripts/setup-workspace-template.sh
   ```

2. **Create Workspace** (via frontend):
   - User creates workspace through web interface
   - Workspace automatically includes fully configured MCP server
   - No additional setup required

3. **Use MCP Tools**:
   - Open Cline in the new workspace
   - MCP tools are immediately available
   - Start deploying static applications

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Available
- Check that the workspace was created after running `setup-workspace-template.sh`
- Verify the workspace template was properly copied to kind nodes
- Check workspace logs for MCP server build errors

### Build Failures
- Ensure Node.js installation succeeded in the workspace
- Check that TypeScript source files are present in the template
- Verify npm dependencies can be installed

### Permission Issues
- Workspace runs as root, so permissions should not be an issue
- Verify the workspace template files have correct permissions on kind nodes

## Legacy Files

The following files are now **deprecated** since MCP configuration is automatic:
- `workspace/configure-mcp.sh` - No longer needed
- `workspace/mcp_settings.json` - Configuration is auto-generated

These files remain for reference but are not used in the automated process.

## Next Steps

1. Run the template setup script to copy MCP server to kind nodes
2. Create new workspaces through the frontend
3. Start using MCP tools immediately in Cline
4. Deploy static applications using the provided tools

The MCP server integration is now seamless and requires no manual intervention!
